                or being sick to my stomach on the

                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/StSebastian.jpg" data-position-x="-360" data-position-y="100">St. Sebastian</span><br>
                partly because of my love for you, partly because of 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/yoghurt.jpg" data-position-x="-200" data-position-y="100">your love for yoghurt</span>
                <br>
                partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches<br>
                partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary<br>
                it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still<br>
                as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it<br>
                in the warm 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/light.jpg" data-position-x="-420" data-position-y="-200">New York 4 o’clock light </span>
                we are drifting back and forth<br>
                between each other like a 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/trees.jpg" data-position-x="-200" data-position-y="60">tree</span>
                breathing through its spectacles</p>
                
                <p>and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint<br>
                you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I look<br>
                at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world<br> except possibly for the
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/ThePolishRider.jpg" data-position-x="-300" data-position-y="-350"><em>Polish Rider</em></span> 
                occasionally and anyway it’s in the 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/Frick.jpg" data-position-x="-200" data-position-y="-400">Frick</span><br>
                which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time<br>
                and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism<br>
                just as at home I never think of the
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/NudeDescending.jpg" data-position-x="-400" data-position-y="-520"><em>Nude Descending a Staircase</em></span>
                or<br>
                at a rehearsal a 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/HeadofAWoman.jpg" data-position-x="-400" data-position-y="-500">single</span>

                of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me<br>
                and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them<br>
                when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank<br>
                or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/horse2.jpg" data-position-x="-100" data-position-y="-450">rider</span>
                as carefully<br>
                as the 
                <span class="hover-image" data-image="images/horse1.jpg" data-position-x="-100" data-position-y="-400">horse</span><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience<br>
                which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it</p>
